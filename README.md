Internship project for VLift

VLift is a portal to connect consumers with service professionals like carpenters, plumbers, etc. without the involvement of a third party. Consumers post the jobs they need to get done on the portal along with its description, whereas professionals looking to pursue those jobs bid for them, specifying the amount of days and pay they are willing to comply with. The user is then left with the decision to accept or reject these bids and employ the particular person for the job.
